# TransientLabel

This library produces a label which displays a value for a fixed duration, then disappears. It is useful in cases where you want to view chagnes to a value while it is changing, 
but not be a distraction when the value isn't changing. It is used by the [NumericGauge](https://github.com/JoshuaSullivan/NumericGauge/) library to display the current value of 
the slider.

It is provided for both UIKit and SwiftUI.
